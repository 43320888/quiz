It's important to know that the science is mixed and some studies don't show this correlation. However, if your AMH is low, be prepared to potentially go through menopause at an earlier age than average.\"", "amh_average": "\"<strong>Average AMH shouldn't affect the window between kids</strong>\r\nQuick reminder: AMH is produced by the follicles surrounding your yet-to-be ovulated eggs. If you have an average amount of AMH, you likely have an average number of eggs.\"\r\n\r\n\"<strong>Average AMH can mean average menopause timing</strong>\r\nStudies show that if you have an average AMH level for your age, you are likely to reach menopause around the average age of 51. Keep in mind this age varies based on multiple factors including ethnicity.\"", "amh_high": "\"<strong>High AMH can be an indicator of PCOS</strong>\r\nPCOS is a condition that can lead to irregular (or no) ovulation. Without ovulation, natural pregnancy isn't possible so PCOS can increase the time between kids. \r\nBTW: 1 in 10 women has PCOS and it goes largely undiagnosed. Let's change that!\"\r\n\r\n\"<strong>High AMH could indicate later menopause</strong>\r\nThe science is mixed on this one. Studies have shown that high AMH levels are associated with a longer time to menopause, while other studies have not. If your AMH is high, be prepared that you may go through menopause at a later age.\"", "fsh_low": "\"<strong>Consistently low levels of FSH can indicate a problem with ovulation</strong>\r\nWithout enough FSH, the hormone that matures follicles, your ovaries might not release an egg. This can prevent you from getting pregnant and extend the window between kids.\"\r\n\r\n\"<strong>Low FSH shouldn't interfere with menopause timing</strong>\r\nChanges in FSH usually happen closer to menopause, whereas AMH generally declines throughout adulthood. BTW: FSH rises with age. As you get older, your body needs to produce more to get your ovaries moving.\"", "fsh_average": "\"<strong>Average FSH shouldn't affect time between kids</strong>\r\nSince an average FSH level suggests that your pituitary gland is making enough FSH to kickstart your ovaries, it doesn't have any implications for time to pregnancy.\r\nBTW: FSH is important for male reproduction, too. Low levels can indicate poor sperm production.\"\r\n\r\n\"<strong>Average FSH shouldn't interfere with time to menopause </strong>\r\nNormal FSH can indicate a normal ovarian reserve. For a better snapshot of egg quantity, FSH should be measured alongside E2 and AMH.\r\nBTW: Changes in FSH usually happen closer to menopause, whereas AMH generally declines throughout adulthood.\"", "fsh_high": "\"<strong>Consistently high FSH on the third day of your period could mean that you're entering the menopausal transition</strong>\r\nThis means that your pituitary gland is releasing more FSH to kick-start ovaries as the number of eggs decreases. The menopause transition is associated with lower conception rates and a longer time between kids.\"\r\n\r\n\"<strong>Two measures of high FSH within two months can indicate that you're entering the menopausal transition</strong>\r\nBTW: This happens when your pituitary glad acts like a gas pedal, producing FSH to boost follicle growth.\"", "e2_low": "\"<strong>Low levels of E2 can increase the time between kids</strong>\r\nE2 can reflect poor follicle development and egg quality\u2013\u2013it can also affect your uterine lining which needs to be comfy enough for an egg to implant. If you have low E2 you and your doctor can work to balance things out so that it doesnt affect conception.\"\r\n\r\n\"<strong>Low E2 isn't associated with menopause timing</strong>\r\nHowever it's important to keep tabs on E2 after menopause, as lower levels at menopause are associated with risks of cardiovasular disease and osteoporosis. \r\nBTW: After menopause, E2 levels decline significantly.\"", "e2_average": "\"<strong>Average E2 doesn't have an impact on time between kids</strong>\r\nAverage E2 likely means that your follicles are secreting the hormone and ovulating normally.  \"\r\n\r\n\"<strong>Average E2 isn't associated menopause timing</strong>\r\nAs we mentioned earlier, E2 is an important fertility ingredient and it fluctuates throughout your cycle. \r\nBTW: When you get closer to menopause, E2 levels can fluctuate significantly.\"", "e2_high": "\"<strong>High E2 can suppress your FSH</strong>\r\nHigh E2 alone doesn't mean it will take longer to conceive, but if E2 is consistently high on the third day of your period and your FSH is average or slightly high, it could mean that you're entering the menopausal transition. The menopause transition is associated with lower conception rates and a longer time between kids.\"\r\n\r\n\"<strong>High E2 levels can suppress FSH levels</strong>\r\nIf your E2 is consistently high on the third day of your period and your FSH is average, this could that you're entering the menopausal transition. It's important to measure these two hormones together to get a holistic picture.\"", "lh_low": "\"<strong>Low LH can affect time between kids</strong>\r\nIf your LH levels are consistently low on the third day of your period, this can mean irregular (or no) ovulation. This is something you and your doctor can balance out when you're ready for kids.  \"\r\n\r\n\"<strong>Low LH isn't associated with menopause timing</strong>\r\nInstead, doctors measure LH because low levels can signal a problem with ovulation. \r\nBTW: LH and FSH are called gonadotropin hormones because they send signals to the gonads (ovaries in women and testicles in men).\"", "lh_average": "\"<strong>Average LH doesn't affect the time between kids</strong>\r\nAverage LH is behaving like it should\u2013as the \"ovulation kick-starter\" of your cycle. \r\nBTW: You can predict ovulation be measuring LH levels in your urine!\"\r\n\r\n\"<strong>Average LH isn't associated with menopause timing</strong>\r\nHaving an average LH likely means that ovulation is happening every month.\r\nBTW: A spike in LH is what triggers the ovaries to ovulate.\"", "lh_high": "\"<strong>Consistently high LH on the third day of your period could mean that you're entering the menopausal transition</strong>\r\nThis is really important to know because this period is associated with lower conception rates and a longer time between kids.\"\r\n\r\n\"<strong>Consistently high LH is associated with menopause timing</strong>\r\nIf your LH levels are consistently high on the third day of your period, this could mean that you're entering the menopausal transition. This is because a lack of estrogen fails to inhibit the negative feedback system of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, leading to higher levels of LH.\"", "prl_low": "\"<strong>Low PRL can impact ovulation.</strong>\r\nIrregular ovulation can increase the time between kids&mdash;fewer eggs released by the ovaries means fewer chances for conception. BTW: In pregnancy, PRL levels can increase up to 20x!\"\r\n\r\n\"<strong>Low PRL isn't associated with menopause timing</strong>\r\nThere's no need to worry that if your PRL is low you will go through menopause earlier. \r\nBTW: A few years after menopause, PRL levels decrease significantly.\"", "prl_average": "\"<strong>Average PRL doesn't affect the time between kids</strong>\r\nBTW: PRL is the hormone responsible for milk production.\"\r\n\r\n\"<strong>Average PRL isn't associated with menopause timing</strong>\r\nInstead, doctors measure PRL to determine if there is a problem with ovulation.  \r\nBTW: PRL levels peak during sleep.\"", "prl_high": "\"<strong>High PRL can impact ovulation</strong>\r\nTrouble with ovulation can increase the time between kids. \r\nBTW: Even women with high levels of prolactin still ovulate if they have enough energy to sustain a pregnancy.\"\r\n\r\n\"<strong>High PRL isn't associated with menopause timing, so there's no need to worry that if your PRL is high you will go through menopause earlier </strong>\r\nBTW: PRL levels can rise from doing things like exercise or eating.\"", "tsh_low": "\"<strong>Low TSH can indicate hyperthyroidism</strong>\r\nIrregular ovulation is more common in women with hyperthyroidism.
