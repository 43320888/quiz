Someone in their 40s, maybe? I was 23 when my husband and I started trying to have kids, and we had no idea it would take six years and five rounds of <a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/egg-freezing-ivf-cost/">in vitro fertilization (IVF)</a>. We had no idea that I had poor quality eggs and would need to use an egg donor. It turns out that I was an exception to the rule that one of the biggest factors in one's fertility is age.</p>
<p>The truth is, getting pregnant at any age isn’t always as simple as it's made out to be. But how old is too old? It’s not as clear cut as you would think. We talked with Dr. Joshua Klein, co-founder and reproductive endocrinologist at Extend Fertility, and got the scoop on fertility as it relates to your age and reproductive health.</p>
<h2 id="eggsabfdwhenitcomestoageandfertility">Eggs: A BFD when it comes to age and fertility</h2>
<p>There are all sorts of factors that go into whether or not you can successfully get pregnant and carry a baby to term. First, let’s talk about your ovarian reserve. You may remember from high school health class that while a man is a sperm-making factory, a woman is born with all the eggs she will ever use in her lifetime. (This isn't necessarily true - keep reading to find out why.) In order to conceive on your own, the eggs need to be of good quality — genetically normal in other words — meaning no damage at the cellular level, and you need to have enough of them in your ovaries. Those eggs need to ovulate, they need to be able to pass through the fallopian tube, they need to be fertilized by sperm and then they need to implant in the uterine wall.</p>
<p>“As a woman ages, because there are more and more genetically abnormal eggs, the likelihood of ovulating a healthy egg in any given month decreases — directly leading to a decreasing chance of healthy pregnancy,” Dr. Klein explains. In older women — as well as some younger — eggs are subjected to damage, and age, just like any other cell in the body. Over time, these things cause damage to the eggs, making them “abnormal” as opposed to “normal.”</p>
<h2 id="sowhendoesfertilityactuallydecline">So when does fertility actually decline?</h2>
<p>Is there a sweet spot where you have the best chances of conceiving? Fertility <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24559617/">starts to really decline</a> around age 32, and then more rapidly each year or two once you hit your mid-to-late 30s. He explains that it’s beneficial to investigate your fertility potential and one choice you can make is to freeze your eggs to lessen your risk of fertility problems, but that's also a complicated and deeply <a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/freeze/">personal decision</a>.</p>
<p>Contrary to old adages and plain old misinformation, fertility doesn't come to a halt when you turn 35. That’s a misconception, because while natural fertility is at its peak in your early 20s, there's actually a gradual fertility decline after that and more so in your 30s — especially your late 30s. And while egg reserves start depleting as you age, it’s also important to understand that women in their 20s and early 30s can also have low egg supply — as was the case for me.</p>
<h2 id="conceivinginyour30sandbeyond">Conceiving in your 30s and beyond</h2>
<p>&quot;Older&quot; women (over 35) will more likely have a harder time conceiving every menstrual cycle and will, therefore, take longer to get pregnant, according to a <a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(16)00152-7/fulltext">recent study</a>. The chances of having a miscarriage, unfortunately, also increase the older you get. Often, this is due to the age of the eggs themselves, as older eggs have a higher chance of being chromosomally abnormal. The likelihood of developing <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/getting-pregnant/in-depth/pregnancy/art-20045756">high blood pressure and diabetes</a>, which can complicate pregnancy and birth, also rise. “Both conditions are increased in older women, and exacerbated in those who are overweight,” explains Dr. Klein.</p>
<p>It might seem that a good solution to conceiving when you’re older would be IVF,  and while IVF is an amazing option when you’re having trouble conceiving, it’s definitely not a guarantee, and when you’re over 40, it’s unfortunately not very successful.</p>
<h2 id="factvsfictionmenandinfertility">Fact vs. fiction: Men and infertility</h2>
<p>It's a misconception that a man can have kids into old age because he can continuously produce sperm. Both men and women face certain realities when it comes to fertility and aging. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3253726/">According to the data</a>, sperm quality is one aspect of male fertility that deteriorates over time - poor <a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/sperm/">sperm motility</a> and morphology (how well they move and how normal-looking they are), as well as a low concentration of semen, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4009560/">genetically abnormal semen</a>. “It‘s also important to remember that as men age, issues like coital frequency (how often intercourse occurs between couples) and/or erectile dysfunction <a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(13)00516-5/fulltext">may play a role</a> in prolonging the time to pregnancy in their partners,” says Dr. Klein.</p>
<h2 id="whatdoidowiththisinformationifimnotreadytohavekidsyet">What do I do with this information if I'm not ready to have kids yet?</h2>
<p>The idea of having kids can look very different depending on how old you are and the circumstances in your life. “The only mistake women can really make is not to get the appropriate information to help them make an educated choice,” explains Dr. Klein. He encourages all women to become informed about their fertility so that they can make a decision that is best for them.</p>
<p>Modern Fertility testing can give you a profile on your current fertility and allow you the control to do what you want with the results. I can’t help but feel things could have been different with my infertility journey had I had more information at my fingertips. I wish I would have known I had a low AMH and a genetic mutation that could have been the cause of my miscarriages. I wish I would have moved on to donor eggs sooner instead of endure three rounds of IVF with my own. I am glad, however, about gritting my teeth and going through fertility treatments at 23 when everyone around me told me I was still young and I had time. When it comes to our bodies, knowledge is power and we’re our own best advocates for our fertility and health.</p>

For those who haven’t spent time trying to conceive a baby, you’re probably a lot more familiar with the period part of your cycle than with ovulation. If the last time you got an in-depth description of ovulation was high school sex ed, here’s the low-down on what’s going on during this phase.</p>
<h2 id="thenittygritty">The Nitty Gritty</h2>
<p>There are 4 phases of <a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/yoga/">your menstrual cycle</a>: menstrual, follicular, ovulation, and luteal. Ovulation is the shortest phase, lasting only a day or two out of a cycle that can be between 22 and 35 days. The monthly process of ovulation is governed by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0022598/">hormones which relay chemical signals</a> between your brain and your ovaries that let your body know when to release an egg each month.</p>
<p>During the follicular phase, the phase preceding ovulation, the brain releases follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) which causes multiple <a href="https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/estrogen-and-menstrual-cycle-humans">follicles in your ovaries</a> to mature. However, toward the end of the follicular phase, in the days right before ovulation, only one follicle fully matures an egg to release into the fallopian tube. As this one follicle matures, it begins to produce <a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/ovarian-reserve/">estradiol</a>, a form of estrogen. The estradiol in this mature follicle cues the brain to increase production of luteinizing hormone. Luteinizing hormone (LH) in turn cues the follicle to grow bigger in size until it eventually ruptures, releasing the egg into the fallopian tube. The other follicles begin to disintegrate. As soon as the egg has been released into the fallopian tube, ovulation has begun.</p>
<p>The act of ovulation transforms the follicle that released an egg into what is called the <em>corpus luteum</em> which is latin for “yellow body.” The <em>corpus luteum</em> produces the hormone progesterone. Progesterone prepares the body for pregnancy if the egg is fertilized. An egg only survives for <a href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/conception_how_it_works/">12-24 hours</a> and must be fertilized by sperm in this time if a pregnancy is to be achieved. Typically fertilization happens in the fallopian tube. Then the egg continues its journey down the tube and into the uterus. The journey to the uterus takes about <a href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/conception_how_it_works/">30 hours</a>. Once in the uterus, a fertilized egg may implant in the uterine wall. This takes <a href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/conception_how_it_works/">5 or 6 days</a>. If implantation occurs, the implanted embryo will begin to produce human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and that's what a pregnancy test is going to detect. If the egg is not fertilized, it dissolves after about <a href="http://americanpregnancy.org/getting-pregnant/understanding-ovulation/">24 hours</a>.</p>
<h2 id="ovulationandbehavior">Ovulation and Behavior</h2>
<p>You may have heard claims that when you are ovulating, you are <a href="http://putslab.la.psu.edu/documents/Puts%20et%20al%202012%20Horm%20Behav%20-proofs.pdf">most attractive to others</a>, your skin glows more, or potential mates can somehow pick up on your heightened fertility. There is still much more research that needs to be done before we can definitively say that ovulation changes how you look or behave. However, there are some preliminary studies that suggest that ovulation might impact attraction, flirtation, and dating/mating behaviors.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/womens-preferences-for-male-behavioral-displays-change-across-the">one study</a> of 237 women showed that women tend to show a heightened preference for social presence and competitiveness in males on fertile days versus non-fertile days. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1690982/pdf/12028782.pdf">Another study</a> with 51 participants shows that women reported being more attracted to someone who was not their primary partner on their fertile days.These participants also noted that their primary partners seemed more attentive and focused on them during their fertile days.</p>
<p>Unlike your period that announces itself with blood, it’s hard to know for sure if you are ovulating. Even <a href="http://americanpregnancy.org/getting-pregnant/ovulation-tests/">ovulation kits</a> and tests work by telling you when you have had a surge of luteinizing hormones in the days before ovulation, they don’t tell you exactly when you are ovulating, but measuring your progesterone levels after you ovulated can confirm whether or not ovulation took place. One sign of ovulation that you might observe is a change in your vaginal discharge (cervical mucus). During ovulation, vaginal discharge is often described to be like <a href="http://americanpregnancy.org/getting-pregnant/signs-of-ovulation/">egg whites</a>: clear and slippery to the touch. You may notice having more discharge than at other times in your cycle. Some people also experience symptoms similar to those that they experience during their period such as breast tenderness. That pain on one side of your lower abdomen that shows up in the middle of your cycle (14ish days before you bleed)? It's called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mittelschmerz/symptoms-causes/syc-20375122">mittelschmerz</a>, and it's <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mittelschmerz/symptoms-causes/syc-20375122">not totally clear why it happens</a> —  it could be the egg enlarging right before it's released from the ovary, or maybe it's blood emerging from the ruptured follicle. Not everyone who ovulates experiences mittelschmerz, and not everyone who does gets it every month. Some people have bleeding and nausea along with this pain. You should talk to your doctor if your mittelschmerz is particularly bad.</p>
<h2 id="ovulationandfertility">Ovulation and Fertility</h2>
<p>Unlike an egg which is only fertile for 12-14 hours, sperm can survive inside the uterus for up to six days after unprotected sex. During ovulation, the mucus covering the cervix is thinner and easier for sperm to make their way through to reach the uterus. The first sperm make their way up the vagina, through the cervix and uterus, and into the fallopian tubes within <a href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/conception_how_it_works/">minutes of ejaculation</a> (minutes!). However, sperm will continue to make their way toward the fallopian tubes over the next six days. For this reason, about a week of each cycle is considered to be a fertile week. If you have sexual intercourse anytime in the week before your egg releases, you have a much higher likelihood of getting pregnant.</p>
<p>Some people also monitor their ovulation to avoid getting pregnant by tracking their basal body temperature, cervical mucus, and/or the calendar. These methods of preventing pregnancy are called FAMs or <a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/fams/">Fertility Awareness Methods</a>. One of the pros of FAMs is that you become more familiar with your cycle, and therefore may be able to spot any oddities that could indicate a medical condition, such as <a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/pcos-and-pregnancy/">polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)</a> or the beginning of the menopausal transition, when periods become more irregular. FAMs also don’t require any type of hormonal instruments (like an IUD) to control fertility. However, potential cons are that properly executing FAMs requires sustained attention and monitoring and, in practice, FAMs are about <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/fertility-awareness">76-88%</a> effective at preventing pregnancy. This means that 24-12 women out of 100 will get pregnant each month when using the FAM method of contraception.</p>

Sometimes it feels like 5 days (like when I learned last week that he was Lysander in his middle school’s performance of <em>A Midsummer’s Night’s Dream</em>). Sometimes it feels like 50 years. Over the years we’ve talked about everything from my student debt to parenting, and likely have more ground to cover as we grow as partners.</p>
<p>We want a family one day but not anytime soon. When I learned about <a href="https://modernfertility.com/">Modern Fertility</a>—a hormone test offering a science-backed way to understand and track fertility—we immediately purchased it. As committed as we are to starting a family, fertility can feel like a black box. We knew where we stood in terms of our 401ks, but had zero insight into our baby-making abilities. We craved a proactive and effective way to understand our fertility and timeline.</p>
<p>I say “our” fertility because it’s an unfortunate and inaccurate tendency to put fertility entirely on the woman’s shoulders. John is part of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/male-infertility/symptoms-causes/syc-20374773">fertility equation</a> from both a biological and a relationship perspective. According to <a href="https://www.asrm.org/topics/topics-index/male-infertility/">The American Society for Reproductive Medicine,</a> 40% of infertility cases stem from male factors, 40% from women, and 20% result in a combination of both. This means John and I are equal stakeholders in our fertility future. Since my fertility impacts our future (and vice versa), it was important to both of us that he pay for half of the test, and I chose for him to be in-the-know when <a href="https://www.shethinx.com/blogs/thinx-piece/fertility-tested-early-before-trying-pregnant">I got my results.</a></p>
<p>Below are four tips that helped us have a productive and supportive conversation about my Modern Fertility results. Before I dive in, I want to emphasize the following: You do you. At the end of the day, that’s the best piece of advice anyone can give or get. These tips are not meant to be prescriptive, they’re simply what worked (and didn’t work) for our relationship.</p>
<h2 id="scheduleatimetotalk">Schedule a time to talk</h2>
<p>This is my number one tip. During the hustle and bustle of our daily lives, John and I don’t have time to dig into important and meaty topics like fertility. When I received my test results, I frantically sprinted into the bedroom—where John was winding down for the night, laptop in tow. Talk about terrible timing.</p>
<p>First, he didn’t appreciate being bombarded with my nervous energy and terms like “<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/ovarianreserve/">ovarian reserve</a>” at 11pm. Second, we didn’t have time to fully absorb the report and have a meaningful discussion before bed. I now also realize that I wasn’t in the right emotional state to begin a conversation about fertility—a difficult situation at work had me particularly on edge. As much as I wanted to pore over my results, I needed space to feel level-headed and less distracted.</p>
<p>Something as important as fertility deserves undivided time and attention. Though I experienced a sense of urgency when I got my results, we set aside a few hours on a Saturday to go through them in a thoughtful way. This also gave me a few days to manage the anxiety around fertility that came up for me when my test results arrived. I scheduled a morning yoga class before we sat down to talk, which made me feel relaxed and even grateful.</p>
<h2 id="setthestage">Set the stage</h2>
<p>Before we bought the Modern Fertility test, I did some research on what the test could and <em>could not</em> tell us about my fertility. I learned that fertility is like a multivariable equation. There are many things that influence it, like general health, sperm, hormones, and fallopian tube and uterus health. For example, if a woman’s fallopian tube is blocked, it's impossible for a sperm to reach a fertilized egg without medical intervention.</p>
<p>Hormones are just one—albeit important—part of the fertility equation. Because Modern Fertility is a hormone test, it <a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/infertile/">can’t tell you if you’re fertile or infertile</a>. As John and I went through my results, he said, “You’re within a normal range for every hormone. Great. We’re good.”</p>
<p>Eh, not quite. The fact that I’m within a normal range for each hormone is a positive sign, but his remark isn’t necessarily true. I realized I could have done a better job setting the stage by letting him know that hormone testing—though significant and an excellent first step—doesn’t tell us everything. Ultimately, there is no “magic crystal ball” test for fertility, other than getting pregnant.</p>
<h2 id="watchyourwords">Watch your words</h2>
<p>It was important to me and John that the Modern Fertility experience be about us, not just about me. To my earlier point, it can be all too easy to only associate fertility with the woman. Even though we’re both vital players when it comes to fertility, in this instance, the spotlight was on my health. I got <em>my</em> blood drawn and we were reviewing <em>my</em> hormone levels.</p>
<p>To counteract potential feelings of one-sidedness, guilt, or shame, we decided to use phrases like “<em>our</em> results,” “<em>our</em> <a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/ovarian-reserve/">AMH levels</a>,” and “<em>our</em> fertility.” Though it felt awkward and a little corny at first, language is powerful. It reinforced the fact that we’re on a team and equally responsible for our fertility future.</p>
<h2 id="comeupwithanextstep">Come up with a next step</h2>
<p>The info we got from Modern Fertility was thorough and easy to understand. But information is only powerful if you <em>do</em> something with it. John and I came up with a next step and tried to name the, “So...what?” of the experience. Because I was “within range” for each hormone, we decided to purchase the test the following year, and even put a reminder on our calendars. We plan to track my hormone levels over time and use this data to make decisions, like when to see a doctor or when to start a more proactive family planning discussion. This is especially important because we know that <a href="https://www.acog.org/Clinical-Guidance-and-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Gynecologic-Practice/Female-Age-Related-Fertility-Decline?IsMobileSet=false">fertility declines with age</a>, even though my hormones levels are &quot;normal.&quot; We are also looking for ways to be more action-oriented regarding <a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/movember/">John’s fertility</a>, too.</p>
<p>Ultimately, taking action based on Modern Fertility’s information is what felt truly empowering as a couple and hopeful future parents.</p>

Anti-mullerian hormone, also known as AMH, is a hormone produced by the cells in your ovarian follicles.</p>
<p>Your anti-mullerian hormone levels are one of the best indicators of ovarian reserve (or how many eggs you have). Your AMH is produced by your developing egg sacs, or ovarian follicles. AMH levels refer to the number of eggs remaining: The lower the AMH levels, the lower ovarian reserve or remaining ovarian follicles. A higher level of AMH in your bloodstream means you have a higher number of eggs in your ovaries. It’s important to keep in mind that this number gives you an idea of quantity, not quality.</p>
<p>Your AMH levels decline naturally <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4870438/">as you age</a>, so low levels in a young person could be a sign of premature loss of fertility due to a depleted ovarian reserve. Having low AMH levels usually means a lower antral follicle count, which is another way a doctor can measure your ovarian reserve. Antral follicles are the developing follicles in the ovaries –– usually measured and detected by transvaginal ultrasound. AMH is produced by antral follicles less than 8 mm in size.</p>
<p>But, it’s not as simple as ‘low is bad and high is good.’ Your AMH levels can be part of a diagnosis of <a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/tag/pcos/">polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)</a>. PCOS is one of the most common reproductive disorders out there and it can be characterized by the presence of many small ovarian follicles. Folks with PCOS often have high levels of AMH, and this can actually prevent ovulation, leading to infertility. PCOS can also complicate a pregnancy, increase your risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and endometrial cancer. Many of these associated diseases can be treated or prevented so an early diagnosis of PCOS can be incredibly helpful in understanding your fertility and health in general!</p>
<p>Your AMH levels can help you prepare for fertility treatments, such as <a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/egg-freezing-ivf-cost/">IVF (in vitro fertilization)</a>. Ovarian stimulation is the stage of IVF in which you're given <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5637249/">drugs</a> to –– you guessed it –– stimulate your ovaries to mature multiple eggs at once, instead of the normal one per cycle. The number of eggs that can be retrieved from your ovaries during IVF depends on your ovarian reserve –– which your AMH levels clue you into. If you have low levels of AMH, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3719310/">it's harder to predict</a> how you'll respond to ovarian stimulation. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26449238">Low AMH can also mean</a> that you may have to do more than one cycle of IVF to get enough eggs to fertilize. Understanding your ovarian reserve can help you plan financially, mentally and physically for the possibility of multiple cycles.</p>
<p>Remember how AMH levels don’t reflect egg quality? That’s important to remember in IVF as well; having <a href="https://www.endocrine.org/news-room/press-release-archives/2013/antimullerian-hormone-predicts-ivf-success">more eggs</a> at the IVF egg retrieval provides an opportunity for a greater number of eggs to fertilize and develop into embryos. But, more eggs does not always mean more embryos. This is because not all of the eggs we produce are viable, or healthy; you could find yourself with a high number of eggs, but not a high number that will fertilize or produce embryos. Your AMH level is also a crucial data point if you’re considering freezing your eggs. If your tests come back with lower levels of AMH, you might want to freeze sooner rather than later and you might need to undergo more than one cycle of freezing to gather enough eggs (or consider getting pregnant sooner rather than later).  If your AMH comes back normal or high but you plan on putting off having kids until a later age, you might want to think about freezing your eggs now because your chances of a successful round of egg freezing are good. Understanding the current status of your ovarian reserve can help you make an informed decision as to when is the best time to <a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/egg-freezing-2/">freeze your eggs</a>. (Keep in mind that freezing your eggs is <a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/freeze/">not an insurance policy for future fertility</a>.)</p>
<p>Knowing and understanding your AMH levels isn’t going to give you all the answers about your fertility present and future. It will, however, give you the information you need to have conversations with your doctors about next steps. Knowing your AMH levels allows you the ability to start planning ––  whether that means freezing your eggs, preparing for multiple rounds of IVF, or considering a timeline for a pregnancy down the road. We’re here for any questions you might have –– and your Modern Fertility test will give you the rundown of your AMH levels and what they might mean for you.</p>

There’s nothing quite as vulnerable as baring it all, literally, in an examining room. The <a href="http://iom.nationalacademies.org/">Institute of Medicine</a> recommends a practice of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1490238/">patient-centered care</a>, which they define as, “providing care that is respectful of, and responsive to, individual patient preferences, needs and values, and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions.” A doctor’s office is supposed to be a place of comfort and care. But what happens when that’s not the case? What do you do? How do you speak up for yourself?</p>
<p>We turned to some of our readers for their advice and broke it down into six simple (or not so simple) ways to set yourself up for success as your own advocate.</p>
<h2 id="numberonefindasupportgroup">Number One: Find a Support Group</h2>
<p>“At some point, you feel a little beaten down. That's when you find your strength. We left the first fertility center after six months. I felt that they were very misleading on how the process went. After joining [a support]group it was nice to see other people felt the same.”  (Danielle, Massachusetts)</p>
<p>Danielle, a hairdresser and salon owner, felt like the cards were stacked against her from the start. As a plus-sized woman in an LGBTQ relationship, she encountered barriers everywhere. Navigating health insurance kept leading to more dead ends and costs. Questions about how her weight might be impacting her fertility felt overwhelming, and at times, quite unnecessary. Although she kept testing negative for gestational diabetes, the test kept coming. Fertility treatments  — and the cost of sperm  —  kept adding up.</p>
<p>Danielle felt alone in the process of advocating for herself.</p>
<p>Her advice to others? Find a support group. “Being able to ask the group about an upcoming appointment and having questions to ask the doctor makes you feel like you are in the game, not just watching it,&quot; she said. Having  other people tell you about their experiences and what they might have done differently shapes the way you may experience your appointments.” Danielle didn’t consider herself an online-group person, but she found the advice and the comradery of a Facebook group for expecting and struggling LGBTQ parents to be invaluable.</p>
<h2 id="numbertwotrustyourself">Number Two: Trust yourself.</h2>
<p>“If something doesn’t feel right, don’t trust it. Fight it. Ask questions. Keep pushing.” (Ani, Portland)</p>
<p>As an RN, Ani is used to navigating patient-doctor relationships, but usually from the side of the medical professional. She admits there’s nothing more frustrating than a patient coming in and claiming to have done the “research,” but really just citing something they saw on TV or the top of their Google search.</p>
<p>When she was pregnant with her first child, however, her perspective shifted. She started to stand her ground, pushing back because it wasn’t just about her, but about her and her baby. The knowledge that she wasn’t alone, but it was her and her daughter, brought out her “mama bear” tendencies early on. She was no longer willing to sit back and be passive in treatment plans, she felt the need to advocate for herself and for her fetus. In this way, being pregnant taught Ani to trust her gut about her treatment;  she knew when something wasn’t right. Ani’s advice is to trust your feelings, to ask more questions, and to push for more tests,even if you’re afraid you’ll come off as demanding.</p>
<h2 id="numberthreeeducateyourself">Number Three: Educate Yourself</h2>
<p>“I have a very healthy respect for anyone with MD/PhD after their name, but that doesn't mean I don't want to educate myself (properly, with peer-reviewed sources) on those topics. I want to understand my own body. This has given me a lot of confidence while in conversations with doctors. I can enter into a conversation with them about my issue, as opposed to being a spectator in my treatment.” (Kat, Oklahoma)</p>
<p>Kat, a professor, found her voice after realizing her doctors weren’t listening. After a miscarriage, she had questions about how her prescribed treatment matched (or didn’t match) what she was experiencing in terms of her cycle. As a scientist, she turned to data and hard facts: she began tracking her ovulation and how she felt each month.</p>
<p>“I started charting my cycle, recording as much data as I could about my own body. I realized I could feel ovulation happen and that, in conjunction with my other data, showed that I was ovulating late in my 28-day cycle (like day 21-23). This made me wonder if I was getting pregnant but that my body was never really aware that I was pregnant before my cycle started.”</p>
<p>The data helped her decide that her doctor’s advice  —  to wait and see if a pregnancy would occur without any medical assistance  — wasn’t working for her. She needed to take matters into her own hands and made an appointment with a fertility doctor.  She advocated for herself in finding a fertility specialist, showing the data, and holding firm in her belief that something wasn’t right. The specialist prescribed supplemental progesterone and worked with Kat and her husband to get to the bottom of what was (and wasn't) happening with their fertility.</p>
<p>Kat’s advice is to educate yourself. Start with what you can learn from your own body - track your symptoms, your cycle, record everything you can around what you’re doing, eating, and feeling. Tracking symptoms and her cycle gave Kat the insight needed to take control of her fertility. She’s now the proud (and very busy) mother of four healthy kids.</p>
<h2 id="numberfourbuildarelationshipwithyourdoctor">Number Four: Build a Relationship with your Doctor</h2>
<p>“I felt like I was asking all the right questions and getting treated like I knew nothing. I’m from a family of doctors. My dad's girlfriend is an OB, I was totally asking the right questions. It’s actually something the fertility specialist mentioned as a reason she loved me as a patient. I asked educated, well-researched question so we could have nuanced conversations about my choices.” (Rebecca, New York)</p>
<p>Rebecca and her husband found themselves being ignored by doctors - partially because they were considered “too young” at 28 and 35 to be seriously worried about infertility. Her first doctor didn’t even want to test Rebecca’s husband to see if any of the <a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/movember/">fertility issues were related to his sperm</a>, but instead told them to keep trying before considering more testing. Rebecca wasn’t willing to wait it out, so she started doing her research,both in terms of finding a new doctor and exploring options for tests and treatment. The more she learned, the more questions she asked.</p>
<p>It wasn’t always easy, but when she found the right doctor, she established a frank relationship. She pushed back, asked clarifying questions, and leaned into her respect for her doctor. Her advice is to find the doctor who values your questions.</p>
<p>Rebecca is now in the middle of a healthy pregnancy; she still talks to her fertility doctor as a friend and confidant because of the relationship they created.</p>
<h2 id="numberfivetakeyourtime">Number Five: Take Your Time</h2>
<p>“It's about trusting your own intellect. If it's not a huge emergency, the doctor should be able to explain the pros and cons to you in a way that allows you to make a decision that you're comfortable with. If there is a judgment call to be made, and all the options are safe (at least for the time being) then you should get to make the choice you want to make.” (Emily, Pennsylvania)</p>
<p>Emily’s pregnancy was high risk; she was carrying identical twins. When she went into labor, one baby was head down, and the other baby was transverse, or laying horizontally.  After being in labor for six hours the doctors on call told her it was time for a C-section, but only because they weren’t trained in delivering a breech baby.</p>
<p>“This all seemed a little premature to me,&quot; Emily said. &quot;How could they know which way the baby would flip? I was angry that no one on call could do the breech extraction. It seemed random and cruel that I could have to have major surgery because they stopped training doctors to do this procedure 20 years ago. So I just said ‘nope’ and that I would wait and see.”</p>
<p>Emily was glad she waited and insisted that everyone else wait. It gave her the time to consider her options. Her then-wife and doctors continued to urge her to have the surgery, but Emily insisted if it wasn’t an emergency, they would wait. Eventually, both babies arrived safely without a C-section. It’s not always possible, but when it is, remember that you are in control. Ask for the time you need to consider your options.</p>
<h2 id="numbersixitsokaytoquityourdoctor">Number Six: It’s Okay to Quit Your Doctor</h2>
<p>“It's a weird power dynamic when you are talking with a doctor. But, the more you can do to feel informed and empowered, the easier it is to stand up for yourself. And, it isn't ok for doctors to make you feel crazy. If you don't feel well, and they don't believe you because blood work says things are normal or whatever, then you need a new doctor.” (Bridgid, Boston)</p>
<p>Bridgid, an educator, struggled with <a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/endometriosis/">endometriosis</a> for years, with doctors telling her the pain and exhaustion was all in her head. The doctor she was seeing made it worse by questioning what she was enduring.</p>
<p>With the pain worsening, she sought out a gynecologist specializing in endometritis and surgery treatments. From visit one the experience was completely different. The doctor not only offered a diagnosis and a treatment plan, but he also did so in an effective and supportive way. It wasn’t an easy journey. She felt isolated for most of the process, but the new doctor changed things.</p>
<p>Brigid wants you to know is that it’s okay to leave your doctor if they aren’t listening or fighting for you. After advocating for herself for years and being ignored, Brigid was worn down. Finding a specialist meant a diagnosis and the right medicines, but it also meant being treated with respect. It was a difference of night and day.</p>
<p>Trying to take care of yourself can be exhausting. Being your own advocate isn’t easy, but with support, research, the right doctor  — and the right relationship with your doctor - you can take your time and trust yourself. Remember that you’re not alone  — <a href="https://modernfertility.com/">Modern Fertility</a> is here to help you understand your fertility and hand you the tools and insights you need to work with your doctor. You’ve got this.</p>

Will you be able to? While fertility is not something that can be 100% accurately predicted, there are certain hormones that can play a role in the big picture. With many women waiting later in life to start families (hello, careers!), fertility testing can allow you to better plan for your future. You also have a choice about where you can get hormone testing done, either in your doctor's office or in your very own home. As a women's health care provider, I'm going to give you the lowdown on what you should should know about the pros and cons of each.</p>
<h2 id="fertilitytestingatyourobgyn">Fertility testing at your Ob/GYN</h2>
<p>Most OB/GYN offices (excluding those that may specialize in fertility) do not routinely order fertility-related lab work. Why? To shoot it straight: it’s generally not covered by insurance, because fertility testing is not considered screening or preventative. Because of this, many insurance companies won’t cover the tab for any fertility-related labs tests or visits. Certain tests, like hormone levels, may be drawn, but usually only if there is a reason to do so (for example, if your periods are irregular).</p>
<p>As a women’s healthcare provider, I <em>never</em> want patients to get surprise bills in the mail. So while lab testing may be performed under my supervision, I can’t always vouch for what sort of bill you may receive. In order to avoid these question-mark costs, I often coach patients on basic family planning practices, like birth control counseling when not trying to conceive, and ovulation tracking when trying.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy?search=fertility&amp;source=search_result&amp;selectedTitle=1~150&amp;usage_type=default&amp;display_rank=1">UptoDate</a>, 85% of couples will conceive within the first 12 months of trying. Because of that statistic, fertility testing and work-ups are not regularly performed until a couple has not conceived within that time frame. Which is great, unless you’re that other 15%. For that 15%, fertility labs and work-ups will come into the picture  —  but only after that 6-12 months of trying (that's 6 months if you're over 35, and 12 months if you're under). Even then, insurance coverage may not be a guaranteed thing. So, if you’re wanting to test before you start trying, Modern Fertility is your best bet.</p>
<h2 id="testingthroughmodernfertility">Testing through Modern Fertility</h2>
<p>One of the biggest perks to using Modern Fertility is that there is no surprise cost; you know exactly what you’re paying, up-front. And, similarly to a gyno visit, you can use your <a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/fsa-hsa/">HSA or FSA account</a> to cover the tab. Not so similar to a gyno visit? A visit to your healthcare provider isn’t needed. Testing can be done at home with a simple finger prick; all you have to do is send your samples to our lab for analysis. If you’re not comfortable performing the finger prick yourself, you can also head to a nearby lab for a blood draw.</p>
<p>Fertility tests are a little more complicated than most; because hormone levels naturally fluctuate throughout our cycle, values will vary depending on the day. To get the most accurate testing, most labs that evaluate ovarian reserve have to be performed on certain cycle days; these lab tests are most accurate on the third day of your period. So, if you can’t get to your OB/GYN office on that certain day or have an irregular period and are not sure when your day three will arrive, you may be out of luck until next month. Additionally, certain lab tests require an eight hour fast, so are best done first thing in the morning before eating breakfast or exercising. An at-home finger prick may be the easiest way to avoid missing the window if your schedule doesn’t always allow for last-minute appointments, you have an irregular period, or you simply don’t want to bother getting out of your pajamas or skipping your morning smoothie.</p>
<p>Another benefit to using <a href="http://modernfertility.com/">Modern Fertility</a> is the access to trained healthcare providers. Physicians (and ones who work in the fertility field, no less) interpret your results in a patient-friendly way, making your report easy to understand. The role of each hormone in fertility is explained in detail, and your own results are shown on a scale, so you can see exactly where you fall. For all results, whether they’re low, normal, or elevated, Modern Fertility provides a summary of what that may mean for you. 1:1 consult with a fertility nurse is also included in the cost, so you can check in with any questions. If you love your healthcare provider (and we hope you do!), you can bring your results to them to discuss along with a printable doctor discussion guide. Another cool feature that Modern Fertility offers (that you likely won’t get at your gyno) is a <a href="https://modernfertility.com/timeline/">timeline tool</a>, which allows you to plug in your desired age to have kids (and how many!), to create a personalized fertility timeline.</p>
<p>Lab testing for fertility can be performed at your OB/GYN office or at home (or at a lab) through Modern Fertility. While both will give you the same results, Modern Fertility is typically more cost-effective <em>and</em> easier, since you don’t even have to leave your house. The added support, through physician-read reports, fertility nurse consults, and the Modern Fertility online community, is just a bonus (but a pretty great one, if you ask me). So if you’re considering proactive fertility lab work, whether you’re a planner or just plain curious, Modern Fertility can deliver results and tools in a way that makes family planning easy.</p>

With any nicotine use, sperm and semen quality suffer, egg cells are damaged, and problems with the fallopian tubes may occur. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nicotine-dependence/symptoms-causes/syc-20351584">Nicotine use - and dependence</a> - isn’t good for your health - period. But what about <a href="https://www.centeronaddiction.org/e-cigarettes/recreational-vaping/what-vaping">vaping</a>? Can you vape while pregnant? Does vaping have a negative effect on female fertility?</p>
<h2 id="whatisvaping">What is vaping?</h2>
<p>Vaping is an alternative to traditional cigarettes, involving inhaling vapors produced by an e-cigarette (or similar device). Electronic cigarettes are essentially electronic nicotine delivery systems. To vape, one uses a cartridge containing nicotine, propylene glycol, and a battery. When you inhale, the nicotine is vaporized through the mouthpiece. E-cigarettes aren’t regulated in the same way as traditional cigarettes, which means there’s a lot we don’t know about what might be going into the body.</p>
<h2 id="soisvapingsafe">So, is vaping safe?</h2>
<p>Nope. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4458373/">E-cigarettes</a> lack many of the substances found in regular tobacco, so they are often perceived as a safer smoking alternative. A <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.6b01741">study</a> published in Environmental Science &amp; Technology in July 2016 identified harmful emissions in the vaping vapor, including carcinogens and irritants. These irritants were found at a much lower level than in conventional cigarettes but were still present at dangerous levels. Vaping might be better for you than cigarettes, but it’s not safe. The <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/quit-smoking-tobacco/is-vaping-safer-than-smoking">American Heart Association makes it clear</a> that vaping isn’t a safer option - although a <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/healthy_heart/know_your_risks/5-truths-you-need-to-know-about-vaping">study</a> at Johns Hopkins makes room for the idea that while vaping isn’t good for you, it might be slightly safer than traditional cigarettes. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198047">Studies</a> show vaping is <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/90-percent-of-smokers-couldnt-quit-after-vaping-one-year#1">not always a successful</a> way to cut down on cigarette smoking.</p>
<h2 id="canvapingimpactmyfertility">Can vaping impact my fertility?</h2>
<p>Truth be told, there is not much research on vaping's effects on fertility - but what we do know doesn’t make a great case for it. Vaping can impact sperm, and not in a good way. <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/headlines/2018/sep/vaping-bad-your-health">Researchers at University College London</a> (UCL) studied the issue of vaping and fertility, and they found that beyond the worries of nicotine and additives, the flavoring in “vape juice,&quot; a mixture of water, food grade flavoring, a choice of nicotine levels or zero nicotine, and propylene glycol or vegetable glycerin can affect sperm. The study found that vape juices greatly diminished fertility: bubblegum flavor killed off cells in the testicles and the cinnamon flavored vape juice negatively impacted sperm motility (how sperm moves and swims). <a href="http://eyesonhkbu.hkbu.edu.hk/index.php/en-GB/in-focus/1772-are-electronic-cigarettes-really-safe">Research done by the Baptist University in Hong Kong</a> demonstrated a link between the toxins found in e-cigarettes and fertility issues as well. Following the study, Hong Kong health called for an immediate and total ban on all e-cigarettes.</p>
<p>If you plan on getting pregnant in the future staying away from all nicotine is a good idea. That being said, if you are a cigarette smoker, switching to vaping could be less harmful to your fertility because you are ingesting less nicotine. (But if you are pregnant, vaping is not a less harmful alternative to cigarettes.) While studies show that vaping is less harmful than traditional cigarettes, all of the same warnings apply: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3719292/">nicotine</a>, which is found in e-cigarettes, can definitely impact your fertility; toxins can damage the ovarian follicles and nicotine causes damage to eggs as they develop.</p>
<p>Both smoking cigarettes and vaping can be hard habits to kick, so if you're trying to quit, find a supportive community to help you, and talking with your healthcare provider.</p>

It's the worst. What is going on? A strong (and never-ending!) urge to urinate could indicate that you have a urinary tract infection (UTI). Whether you've had a UTI before, you're experiencing one for the first time (we are so sorry), or you're just curious in general, we're here to give you the basics on UTIs. Let's go!</p>
<h2 id="whatsauti">What's a UTI?</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-tract-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20353447">urinary tract infection (UTI)</a> is an infection in any part of your urinary system — your kidneys, ureters, bladder, and/or your urethra. There are two kinds of UTIs: cystitis and urethritis. Cystitis is an infection of the bladder. Urethritis is an infection of the urethra. UTI’s can be quite painful  —  and, unfortunately, a fairly common fact of life.</p>
<p>While anyone can get a UTI, having a <a href="https://m.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/Urinary-Tract-Infections-UTIs">shorter urethra</a> (which is part of the anatomy associated with having a vulva) means more susceptibility to UTIs. Some folks are simply more prone to UTIs because the cells in their vaginal areas and urethras are just more easily invaded by bacteria than others.</p>
<h2 id="howdoiknowifihaveauti">How do I know if I have a UTI?</h2>
<p>In addition to that persistent need to pee, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-tract-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20353447">watch out for</a> these other common symptoms of a UTI:</p>
<ul>
<li>A burning sensation when urinating</li>
<li>Frequent urination resulting in small amounts of urine</li>
<li>Urine that appears cloudy</li>
<li>Urine that appears red, bright pink or cola-colored — a sign of blood in the urine</li>
<li>Strong-smelling urine</li>
<li>Kidney pain</li>
<li>Pelvic pain, especially in the center of the pelvis and around the area of the pubic bone</li>

<p>A visit to a doctor for a quick urine test will tell you if you have a UTI. The treatment is a series of antibiotics and possibly something to help with the pain and burning. (Fun fact: <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/phenazopyridine-oral-route/description/drg-20065473">phenazopyridine</a>, the medicine often prescribed to help alleviate the burning, will turn your urine a bold orange color!) While UTIs on their own aren’t too serious, if left untreated, a UTI can spread and cause a kidney infection. So see your healthcare provider if you think you have a UTI!</p>
<h2 id="whatdoessexhavetodowithutis">What does sex have to do with UTIs?</h2>
<p>Sexual intercourse is a common cause of UTIs. It's so common, in fact, it's often nicknamed the “<a href="https://www.healthywomen.org/content/ask-expert/1330/honeymoon-cystitis">honeymoon disease.</a>&quot; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3749018/">Studies show</a> that nearly 80 percent of premenopausal women with a UTI have had sex within the previous 24 hours. During sex, you’re introducing bacteria from the genital area and anus to the urethra. This isn’t restricted to solely penis-in-vagina sex  — toys, fingers, and anything belonging to your sexual partner or foreign to your body can bring germs and bacteria into your urethra and urinary tract.</p>
<p>Your choice of birth control can also increase the chance for infection. <a href="https://www.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/Urinary-Tract-Infections-UTIs?IsMobileSet=false#getting">Using a diaphragm</a> can mean more frequent UTIs. Because of how a diaphragm sits it doesn't allow the bladder to totally empty — which gives urine and bacteria to collect. Using a spermicide can also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12094098">increase the risk</a> of UTIs; put simply, the “good” bacteria in a vagina is killed off with spermicide use.</p>
<h2 id="issextheonlywaytogetauti">Is sex the only way to get a UTI?</h2>
<p>It sure isn't. <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/6-things-you-should-know-about-utis-in-older-adults/">Dehydration can also lead to a UTI</a> (we'll wait while you go drink a big glass of water). Without fluids to keep your urinary tract flushed, bacteria have a chance to grow and flourish. Retaining urine––not emptying your bladder fully or often enough––can also cause a UTI. The longer urine stays in your bladder, the more time bacteria have to grow. Antihistamines can cause urine retention —  so go ahead and blame allergy season for one more thing.</p>
<p>If you’re <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3246510/">postmenopausal</a>, your estrogen changes also impact your urinary tract, making you more vulnerable to UTIs.</p>
<p>Sugar intake can also cause a UTI— when you have a spike or increase in blood sugar, your kidneys process that sugar into the urine. Bacteria love using that sugary urine as a way to thrive in your urinary tract. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27131462">If you’re diabetic</a>,  you’re at risk for recurrent UTIs.</p>
<p>UTIs are considered <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3749018/">recurrent</a> if they're showing up two or more times in six months, or three of more times in a year. People with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4527903/">spinal cord injuries</a>, or nervous system conditions like <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3960762/">multiple sclerosis</a>, are also susceptible to recurrent UTIs.</p>
<h2 id="howdoipreventutis">How do I prevent UTIs?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256"><strong>Stay hydrated.</strong></a> (As a friend of mine always says, “hydrate or die-drate!”) Drinking enough water is one of the most important things you can do to protect against UTIs (and keep your body healthy). Water dilutes your urine. The more water you drink, the more you flush your urinary tract––meaning you’re flushing bacteria before it can turn into an infection.</p>
<p>While you’re hydrating, <strong>add some cranberry juice to the mix.</strong> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3370320/">Studies aren’t conclusive</a> about the mighty cranberry, but most point towards cranberries being helpful in preventing UTIs. Cranberries add acidity to your urine, making it less friendly for bacteria. (If you’re sensitive to acidity in general, cranberries might be hard on you. No matter what, ask your doctor if you should add cranberries to your diet.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4660700/"><strong>Practice good hygiene</strong></a>. If you have a vulva, be sure to wipe from front to back. This helps prevent bacteria spreading into the urethra and keeps your vulva clean and dry. Wear <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-st-louis-region-southwest-missouri/blog/what-you-can-do-to-prevent-urinary-tract-infections">underwear</a> that’s cotton and save the fancy, tight-fitting lace and thongs for special occasions. Avoiding <a href="https://obgyn.coloradowomenshealth.com/health-info/conditions/uti">powders and deodorant sprays</a> will also help keep your vagina clean, dry, and comfortable.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2324774"><strong>Pee before and right after sex</strong></a>. It might sound like a mood-killer, but it will help flush your system and keep UTIs at bay.</p>
<h2 id="doutisimpactfertility">Do UTI’s Impact Fertility?</h2>
<p>The short answer is no. However, having a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4379362/">UTI while you're pregnant</a> isn’t great, since it can lead to <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/urologic-diseases/kidney-infection-pyelonephritis">pyelonephritis</a> (kidney inflammation because of an infection), urosepsis (when the infection gets into your bloodstream), and <a href="https://www.aafp.org/afp/2002/0115/p241.html">increased risk of preterm birth</a>. That said, UTIs are common during pregnancy and can be treated.</p>
<p>If you have a penis, <a href="https://www.dontcookyourballs.com/infections-that-cause-male-infertility/">UTIs can have effects on fertility</a>. The urethra carries both urine and semen outside of the body; if this is something you’re concerned with, be sure to see a doctor.</p>
<h2 id="finallykeeponlearning">Finally, keep on learning.</h2>
<p>One way to stay healthy is to empower yourself with knowledge. Ask your doctor about questions you might have around UTIs. Keep an eye out for how your body reacts when you’re dehydrated––or what happens when you hold in urine. We’re always here to help offer resources around your health and your fertility.</p>

Here's what you need to know"><p>It’s that time of year again, when your health care providers, pharmacies, grocery stores, and commercials diligently remind you to get your flu shot. Some even reward you for doing so (I see that $10 gift card offer, Publix). But what about your friend who swears it gave her the flu? Or your friend who’s pregnant? What if you yourself are thinking of trying to conceive? There's some conflicting information out there, but luckily, we’re going to sort it all out.</p>
<h2 id="whatevenisthefluanyway">What even is the Flu, anyway?</h2>
<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the influenza virus (the proper name for the flu) is spread through the droplets produced when a sick person coughs, sneezes, or talks, and it thrives between the months of October-May. The virus can be spread up to a full day before flu symptoms kick in—meaning, unless you can see into the future, you can easily be exposed, even if you’re careful with the company you keep. A robust immune system during flu season is obviously ideal; however, some people simply can’t help it if their immune system is weak. Those most at risk, and more likely to come down with the flu, are young children, pregnant women, those on medications that may suppress the immune systems (chemo, HIV medications) and the elderly (particularly those in nursing homes). If they do get the flu, they’re also at a higher risk for being hospitalized for flu-related complications.</p>
<h2 id="whatsintheflushot">What’s in the Flu Shot?</h2>
<p>Essentially dead (or “inactive”) strains of the virus, to put it simply. Exposing your body to small amounts of the influenza virus causes your immune system to develop specific flu-fighting antibodies (a protein that helps the immune system). These antibodies, if present, help your immune system better fight off the flu if exposed. You can think of them as very, very small flu warriors.</p>
<h2 id="flushotfactandfiction">Flu Shot: Fact and  Fiction</h2>
<p>You’ve probably had a friend, coworker, or family member denounce the flu vaccine because either “it gave me the flu” or “I still got the flu”. These complaints are very common, and have a lot of us wondering “well, should I still get my shot, then?”. Luckily, the CDC has made a point to get down to the bottom of these flu shot excuses.</p>
<p><strong>Fiction: The flu vaccine will give you the flu.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fact: The flu vaccine can not give you the flu.</strong> Because the vaccine uses inactive strains, or from proteins from a virus (and not the actual virus itself), your body does not respond to them in the same way it would an active flu virus. According to the CDC,  &quot;The weakened viruses are cold-adapted, which means they are designed to only cause infection at the cooler temperatures found within the nose. The viruses cannot infect the lungs or other areas where warmer temperatures exist.&quot;</p>
<p>The flu shot can result in some common side effects, like soreness and redness at the injection site, headache, a low-grade fever, nausea, and muscle aches, all of which should be mild and resolve in a few days.</p>
<p><strong>Fiction: You can't get the flu if you've gotten vaccinated.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fact: While your overall risk post-flu shot is decreased 40-60%, you unfortunately can still get the flu.</strong> If you are exposed before your body has made antibodies ( it can take up to two weeks after vaccination to create them) or if you are exposed to a strain that wasn’t covered by the vaccine, you may get the flu. However, studies have shown that those who have gotten the flu vaccine typically experience less severe flu symptoms. Sign me up!</p>
<p><strong>Fiction: You shouldn't get the shot if you're pregnant or planning to become pregnant.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fact: According to <a href="https://www.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/The-Flu-Vaccine-and-Pregnancy?IsMobileSet=false">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)</a>, it is recommended that all pregnant women get the flu shot.</strong> In pregnancy, the immune system is weakened, putting pregnant women at a higher risk of developing the flu, which can be life-threatening. Additionally, the flu antibodies generated following a flu shot may be passed on to the baby at delivery (which is awesome, because the CDC does not recommend the flu shot be administered until babies are at least 6 months old). For those of you considering pregnancy, ACOG reports that there is no increased risk of miscarriage or impact on fertility following vaccination. The safety and efficacy of the flu shot for pregnant or trying-to-be-pregnant mothers far outweighs the potential risks of developing the flu.</p>
<h2 id="soireallyshouldgettheflushot">So... I really should get the flu shot?</h2>
<p>Yes, you really should. The flu vaccine is safe and recommended for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/whoshouldvax.htm#flu-shot">almost everyone</a>. And you do actually need to get it every year. The CDC recommends an annual vaccine for a few reasons; for one, your immune system weakens over time, so it’s good to get it re-boosted, so to speak. The flu shot can also change from year to year. Each year, researchers use recent data to predict which flu strains may be most popular in the upcoming flu season. Those specific strains will be included in the vaccine. But, just like in the fashion world, they may not have been so en-vogue last year. And if not? Those strains probably weren’t included in the last vaccine you received. So the bottom line here: get the flu shot, and get it every year.</p>

As the co-founders of <a href="https://getmaude.com/">maude</a>, a modern sex essentials company, they thought the industry was gendered and agist in an outdated way. So they launched a business committed to quality, inclusivity (for all ages and genders), and simplicity. Goicochea, who worked in the healthcare sector, social media, brand strategy, and was a first employee at Everlane before co-founding maude, says the company's mission is &quot;to improve sexual health and happiness for everyone.&quot;<br>
maude is also about disruption, says Epstein, the former Head of Product Development and Sex Toy Design at Kiki De Montparnasse. The company seeks to &quot;encourage healthy conversations around sex,&quot; a radical notion in a world where talking about sexuality is still stigmatized and silenced.</p>
<h2 id="whatdidyouwanttobewhenyougrewup">What did you want to be when you grew up?</h2>
<p><strong>Dina:</strong> I always wanted to be a designer. . . sometimes more of an artist, but always a creative. Subconsciously I was always an entrepreneur. My sister and I had the entire neighborhood mapped out as part of in our babysitting business by the time we were 12 and that energy only grew from there.<br>
<strong>Eva:</strong> I wanted to be an architect because I wanted to be methodically creative. For my 7th birthday, I asked my mom if we could take the train from Detroit (where her family lives) to Albuquerque (home) making a pitstop in Chicago so I could see the Sears Tower. In my freetime, I would sit for hours on the computer. If “digital designer” was really a thing in the 80s, I probably would have said that. I loved building things—on a screen.</p>
<h2 id="whatinspiredyoutodotheworkthatyoudowhatsyourfavoritepartofyourdaytoday">What inspired you to do the work that you do? What’s your favorite part of your day-to-day?</h2>
<p><strong>Dina:</strong> Sex is an important part of your everyday health. The current sex industry is based on an ideology that treats sex as a novelty or worse, a taboo. We are creating products and taking a wellness approach to making people feel comfortable about sex so they can integrate it into their daily lives. My favorite part of our day to-day is when we get to hear from customers about how happy our products make them and how their lives are better because of maude.<br>
<strong>Eva:</strong> I’ve always believed that our culture could be better if the sexual wellness industry became the leaders for equity, equality, and a healthy perspective on sex which really permeates every aspect of who we are as people. It’s more than just products: It’s people’s sense of self, being lovable, feeling powerful or powerless, feeling equal. Like Dina, when people give us feedback of how we’ve made their lives better, it motivates us to keep moving.</p>
<h2 id="whatadvicedoyouhaveforfolkswhowanttounlearnbadorwronginformationaboutsex">What advice do you have for folks who want to unlearn bad or wrong information about sex?</h2>
<p><strong>Dina:</strong> Your pleasure matters. Having open communication with your partner(s) about your wants/needs and realizing that it's a conversation is so important. Reciprocity!<br>
<strong>Eva:</strong> There are so many resources for quality information that is appropriate for your needs, life stage, etc. Sex is not just for the young and it’s not just for the fearless—it’s for everyone. How you decide to incorporate sex in your life is your business and I encourage you to find what works best for you.</p>
<h2 id="howdoyouthinkinformationaboutsexualhealthandgoodsexcanempoweruterusowners">How do you think information about sexual health and good sex can empower uterus owners?</h2>
<p><strong>Dina:</strong> Knowledge is power regardless of gender. Everyone go educate yourselves!<br>
<strong>Eva:</strong> Sex is dynamic and a broad term so the questions or concerns you have, someone else has had, too. Never feel guilty for educating yourself at any stage of your life—it’s completely human to feel different things as your body and perspectives change and it’s an opportunity to know yourself.</p>

Here are a few of their responses.</p>
<p>&quot;It was almost all covered but the meds (which are several thousands a cycle) were a constant battle to get. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing but the diagnostic testing and a few of the meds was covered. I think the meds were a clerical error, not really covered on purpose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It took so much work, but we got some money back. If we had just let the insurance company do their thing, we would not have gotten more than coverage for meds, which was still a significant cost. We were one of the few lucky ones.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was so lucky to have great insurance through my org when I did IVF in 2013 and most of one cycle was covered.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Almost all my meds were covered but the actual embryo transfer was not. My parents helped us pay for it, which is why we call him the baby my parents bought for us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the five years of trying I've never had anything covered. Not meds, not procedures, nada.&quot;</p>
<p>If this seems rather incongruous, that's because it is. Figuring out insurance and fertility treatments is seldom straight forward, but don't panic! We're here to make sure you have the information you to need to navigate the complexity.</p>
<p><strong>What expenses are we even talking about?</strong></p>
<p>Check out our piece on the <a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/egg-freezing-ivf-cost/">costs of egg freezing and IVF</a> for a deep dive into this. Essentially, there are doctor's appointments to evaluate what's going on, blood tests to assess hormone levels (AMH, FSH, estrogen, etc), and an ultrasound (maybe more than one) to check for things like ovarian cysts and the condition of fallopian tubes, as well to assess your antral follicle count, to measure your <a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/ovarianreserve/">ovarian reserve</a>. If you're freezing your eggs, there's hormonal birth control to take, drugs to inject yourself to mature your eggs, the charge for anesthesia when you go into the clinic for the retrieval, and the retrieval itself. Then there's your rent for the egg storage. Doing more than one cycle to retrieve more eggs? Factor that into the finances.</p>
<p>If you're following up that egg retrieval with IVF or <a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/conceiving-solo/">IUI</a> instead of putting those eggs on ice, there's the fertilization of the retrieved egg, an embryologist who monitors the embryo, injections to prep the uterine lining for receiving that embryo, and the transfer itself. (These costs are going to vary if you're using donor eggs and/or donor sperm.) Again, consider the possibility of multiple rounds of IVF or IUI when you're thinking about these treatments.</p>
<p><strong>So what fertility expenses will my insurance cover?</strong></p>
<p>It depends on what plan you have. Insurance companies have medical boards, and that's who determines whether or not a service should be covered. &quot;Fertility coverage is highly variable and depends on what services the employer has selected,&quot; says <a href="https://www.nm.org/doctors/1306907423/eve-c-feinberg-md">Dr. Eve C. Feinberg</a>, a reproductive endocrinologist specializing in infertility at Northwestern Medical Group. &quot;This can range from absolutely no coverage, to coverage for diagnostic testing to discover the reason for infertility, to full coverage including therapies such as in-vitro fertilization. Insurance companies perceive childbearing as ‘elective’ and do not offer routine coverage.&quot; (Mammograms and pap smears are examples of medically necessary procedures covered by insurance.)</p>
<p>&quot;As a reproductive endocrinologist and fertility specialist, I couldn’t disagree more,&quot;<br>
says OB/GYN and reproductive endocrinologist <a href="http://www.newayfertility.com/">Dr. Daniel Kort</a> of Neway Fertility. &quot;Infertility is like many other diseases with effective treatment options and the potential for a cure.&quot; He adds that while proactive fertility testing - that's testing that assesses whether or not you might have fertility challenges in the future - also isn't covered, he feels that it should be. &quot;The biggest problem with fertility testing is that despite advanced testing methods, it is nearly impossible to determine who will conceive and who won’t conceive based on testing alone. However, with the advancement of fertility preservation techniques, women, men, and couples with abnormal (or normal!) fertility testing can take decisive action based on their results.&quot;</p>
<p>There is some good news - if you live in one of these <a href="https://resolve.org/what-are-my-options/insurance-coverage/infertility-coverage-state/">16 states</a>, there are laws in place that require insurance coverage for infertility treatments. This doesn't make coverage free, however;  if you have private insurance, you're still responsible for copays. Coverage is also only available once you've proved that you meet the criteria for infertility: you've been unable to conceive after trying via timed, unprotected sex for 12 months, or, if  you're over 35, for six months, or if you've been unable to carry a pregnancy resulting in a live birth after a year. If you live in one of the 16 states, make sure to investigate the nuances of the plan. California, for example, requires group insurers to offer coverage of infertility treatments (except IVF), but individual employers can choose if they want to offer diagnostic testing, medication, surgery, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/gamete-intrafallopian-transfer">Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer</a> (that's when eggs are removed from ovaries, combined with sperm, and placed into the fallopian tubes, where they're fertilized) as part of their employee benefit package. Religious organizations can opt out of this coverage.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are five states which legislate that insurance plans must cover treatments for folks whose infertility is medically-induced, i.e. if you had chemotherapy and it impacted your reproductive system.</p>
<p><strong>What does this mean for my fertility future?</strong></p>
<p>Like we said before, don't panic. First of all, there are options for financing infertility treatments if your insurance won't cover it. <a href="https://www.fertilityiq.com/">FertilityIQ</a> is a great source for learning about options for financing treatments <a href="https://www.fertilityiq.com/cost/ivf-refund-and-package-programs">without insurance</a>. Dr. Eve Feinberg is the President and Founder of the <a href="http://www.lifefindsaway.org/">Kevin J. Lederer Life Foundation</a>, a not-for-profit that provides financial assistance to individuals and couples in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin to assist with the cost of infertility treatment or adoption. &quot;There are also over 50 private foundations in the United States that offer financial assistance to individuals and couples struggling with infertility,&quot; she told Modern Fertility. Many fertility clinics, such as Neway Fertility, where Dr. Daniel Kort practices, have financial counselors who guide patients through the process of managing funding.</p>
<p>You can get out in front of the fertility treatment v. insurance debacle. For some tips on how, we turned to Caitlin Ardrey, Modern Fertility's Head of Operations, who knows a thing or two (or one million) about insurance. Call your insurance company's billing department to learn about how your benefits work. &quot;Don't try to draw parallels between your benefits and those of your friends,&quot; says Ardrey. &quot;Understand your own benefits, that's the most important thing.&quot;</p>
<p>Talk to your employer (and/or your HR rep) about what your plan covers, what it doesn't, and what could potentially be covered if it isn't already. If employees make it clear that a plan that covers fertility treatments is desirable, it could impact decisions about picking insurance providers in the future, since that could both attract and retain female employees. Discussing fertility treatments at work, as well as with your friends, also destigmatizes infertility and allows for folks to talk about their experiences, instead of perpetuating silence and shame.</p>
<p>And finally, Modern Fertility was born (pun intended) for this. We want you to get information about your fertility now, while kids are still a hypothetical. You can use your <a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/fsa-hsa/">Flexible Spending Account (FSA) or your Health Savings Account (HSA)</a> to pay for a Modern Fertility test kit. You get test results you can talk about with your healthcare provider, so you can start strategizing ASAP), plus access to our weekly webinar, an invite to the Modern Women community, and the opportunity to chat with a fertility nurse who's an expert in fertility hormones. You deserve to feel powerful and informed when making decisions about your health and your future, and we're here to help make it happen.</p>

As a first step, Rachel stopped taking birth control. Her at-home pregnancy tests kept telling her she wasn’t pregnant, but she wasn’t having a period. Not sure what was going on, but hearing alarm bells, she saw a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/reproductive-endocrinology-and-infertility-in-minnesota/overview/ovc-20424328">reproductive endocrinologist</a> - a specialist focused on the hormones that impact fertility and the reproductive system. It turns out that she wasn’t actually ovulating with her period. Blood testing and a pelvic ultrasound diagnosed her with <a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/cysters/">Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)</a> and high glucose. Her high glucose results confirmed that she had type 2 diabetes. The information her period gave her by being irregular allowed her to reassess her health as a whole, ultimately saving her from further health complications down the line.</p>
<p>No matter how you feel about having children, or where you are on your journey to being––or not being––a parent, understanding your fertility is important for your health. Clues from your hormones, your menstrual cycle, and your reproductive organs can help you understand your body and your overall well being. Having as much information as possible can help you see the big picture - and help you make decisions that are right for you, your health, and your body.</p>
<p>When learning about your fertility, you’ll probably start hearing about your <a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/ovarianreserve/">FSH</a>. FSH stands for follicle-stimulating hormone, which is responsible for the growth of ovarian follicles (the cellular structures that house your eggs). These follicles produce both estrogen and progesterone (along other hormones) in the ovaries and control aspects of your menstrual cycle. Checking your FSH levels (for an FSH test, blood is drawn) will provide you with information about your fertility - and also let you know what’s going on with your pituitary gland.</p>
<p>From its captain’s seat at the base of your brain, the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypopituitarism/symptoms-causes/syc-20351645">pituitary gland</a> controls the functions of other glands in your body, while producing hormones that impact growth. Because of this, it’s often known as the &quot;master control gland.&quot; Your FSH levels give you and your doctors information about any pituitary disorders or <a href="https://www.hormone.org/hormones-and-health/hormones">hormone imbalances</a> you might have. Quite a few things can impact your hormones and your FSH levels––for instance, stress and being severely underweight. If you’re experiencing hot flashes, night sweats, extreme mood swings, or difficulty sleeping at night, you might be looking at a hormonal imbalance, such as changes in your progesterone levels, as well as those of LH, oxytocin, testosterone, thyroid, cortisol, leptin, or estrogen. Visit your health care provider for a physical exam and blood tests that can help assess what's going on. (<a href="https://modernfertility.com/science/">Modern Fertility's kit</a> also measures most of these hormones, and you can test at home).<br>
Your thyroid can also have an impact on your fertility and testing for thyroid diseases can give you a better idea about your overall health. Your thyroid gland has a say in almost all of the metabolic processes in your body. Thyroid disorders come in many shapes and sizes, they can range from an enlarged gland that needs no treatment to cancer. High levels of the thyroid hormone T4 result in hyperthyroidism. On the flipside, <a href="https://www.endocrineweb.com/conditions/thyroid/hypothyroidism-too-little-thyroid-hormone">hypothyroidism</a>, a disorder of your pituitary gland, occurs when you’re lacking in T4. Hypothyroidism can present itself with a wide variety of symptoms, some of which even resemble early signs of pregnancy. These symptoms include fatigue, weaknesses, weight gain or difficulty losing weight, hair loss, constipation, memory loss, and even irritability. With hypothyroidism, you might also notice an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypopituitarism/symptoms-causes/syc-20351645">irregular period</a> and you may not be ovulating - an occurrence known as an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4307410/">anovulatory cycle</a>. During an anovulatory cycle, you might experience an insufficient level of progesterone, causing heavy bleeding but no actual ovulation. Hormone replacement therapy can be used when anovulatory cycles occur. Studies estimate that around <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15543918">27 million Americans have a thyroid imbalance</a>, meaning at least 10% of people with a uterus may have some degree of thyroid hormone deficiency.<br>
Changes in your menstrual cycle or flow can also indicate health issues. Paying attention to these changes can clue you to something being wrong. Your cycle may not be 30 days (or 28 days), but there should be some pattern to it. If you start to see your period arriving at unexpected times (or not arriving at all), that might be an indication of medical issues. An irregular period might be a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pcos/symptoms-causes/syc-20353439">warning sign for PCOS</a>. Menorrhagia, a heavy flow, that lasts longer than a week can be a symptom of PCOS, as can excess hair growth on one's face, chest, and back. In addition to possible fertility complications, PCOS can increase your risk of heart disease, diabetes and endometrial cancer.</p>
<p>Your period can offer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/womens-health/in-depth/menstrual-cycle/art-20047186">other indications</a> as to the state of your health. If you notice spotting in between your periods, don’t panic. It might mean nothing - or, it could point towards a yeast infection or an <a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/conceiving-with-sti/">STI</a>. Spotting could also be a sign of uterine cancer or cervical cancer. While you’re paying attention to your period, be sure to note the color and smell. Be on the lookout for any changes. Your period normally has a smell attached to it, but a stronger odor than usual, especially one with an overwhelming fish-like smell, or watery menstrual blood could be a sign of an infection.<br>
Cramps are normal, but can also be a sign that something new is going on in your body. Your cramps shouldn’t be excruciating; if you find yourself unable to find relief from over the counter pain medications and a hot water bottle, you might be dealing with something serious, such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/endometriosis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20354661">endometriosis</a>. If you are feeling cramps when you’re not bleeding or in the middle of your cycle, that can also indicate ovarian cysts. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cysts/symptoms-causes/syc-20353405">Ovarian cysts</a> are fluid-filled sacs or pockets that develop on the surface or inside of your ovary. While it’s not uncommon to have cysts, cysts that rupture can cause serious pain. Cysts that develop after menopause can also be cancerous.</p>
<p>The bottom line: being fertile doesn’t necessarily mean you’re healthy. That being said, understanding your fertility can be one more tool in understanding your health and your body. Even if you’re not planning on having children, it's always a good idea to get a handle on your reproductive health. If you are planning on trying soon, Modern Fertility can help you find more answers about your hormone levels, and even your ovarian reserve. Each piece of the health puzzle can help you live a healthier life.</p>

If you’re like us, and want to know the science behind how we test fertility hormones, this one is a must-read.</p>
<p>We’ve posted about the clinical study before (<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/whitepaper/">here’s our deep dive!</a>) but in case you want a refresher or you just prefer the tl;dr version: we showed that the Modern Fertility fingerstick test that you can take at home delivers the same hormone levels as a traditional blood draw. We conducted this study and made sure the results were scientifically sound before launching the test because, here at Modern Fertility, we are all about making sure that the science is ironclad.</p>
<p>The results of our clinical study have always been public on our website (we wouldn't have it any other way). But it was important to us to share and have our findings reviewed by an expert publication like the Green Journal. We're big believers that scientific progress comes from having other, independent experts review, critique, and offer suggestions to improve the work you’ve done––ultimately deciding if it merits publication. This is called the “peer review” process, and it is how scholarly research is validated across disciplines. One of the more important aspects of this process is that it’s anonymous. The authors do not know who is critiquing their study, so those reviewers can be honest in their assessment.</p>
<p>By submitting our study to the Green Journal, we were submitting our methods, analysis and conclusions to the scrutiny of other experts who ultimately decided that the study met good scientific standards and should be shared with the public. We are very excited to see our work in such an esteemed journal and available for other scientists, physicians and you to read!</p>

It is your birthright.</p>
<p>For women, pleasure is often viewed as secondary, selfish, even shameful or wrong. It is extremely important to discuss pleasure openly to create a holistic approach (mind, body and spirit) for ourselves and our relationships.  As a sexual health educator for over ten years, I've built my career on the importance of putting pleasure first.</p>
<p>Pleasure makes life more fulfilling. It reduces stress and helps us stay present and mindful. There are many levels of pleasure, from an incredible toe curling orgasm, to a sensual bath with rose petals. You get to define your own experience of pleasure and what it truly means to you.</p>
<p>I've been  a huge proponent of pleasure for as long as I can remember . I watched <em>Dirty Dancing</em>, a movie about a young woman coming into her sexuality and power at a very young age. It was, and continues to be, an inspiration.  I remember the first time I had an orgasm at 7 or 8 years old. I was terrified because I didn’t understand what had happened. But it felt so good that it became a favorite past time (especially while watching Johnny Castle do the lift). The scenes portraying sensual dancing,freedom, and people taking joy in their bodies and one another was the beginning of my understanding of the importance of pleasure.</p>
<p>I continued my journey of studying pleasure as a high school volunteer educating my peers about safer sex and pregnancy prevention. I loved dispelling knowledge with humor and debunking the awful myths we learned growing up, such as masturbation makes you go insane, or will make you sterile, or give you hairy palms. I decided I wanted to become an advocate for masturbation and self-pleasure. Putting a condom on with my mouth with a banana wasn’t a bad gig either. It always led to a multitude of questions and awe inspired glances. I continued this work in college, as an HIV test counselor. I met with my peers every week and asked the most intimate, private questions during the testing process. How many sexual partners did you have over the last six months? Did you have anal, vaginal or oral sex? Did you sleep with men, women or both? Did you use protection? I loved sitting across from a stranger and creating a safe space with my presence, compassion and empathy as they told me their story.</p>
<p>After graduating college I began working at a local adult toy and lingerie boutique. My colleagues and I created fun, educational workshops that taught people about their bodies. We developed blowjob, anal play, g-spot stimulation and female ejaculation classes that focused on anatomy and physiology. I would visit the local university and teach workshops to students. Every day, I spoke with hundreds of people who had different concerns about their sexual health and wellbeing, whether I was presenting to a health class or a sorority house. Women often worried they were too dry, others worried they were too wet. Some women had never had orgasms, but their partners had no idea. People began revealing their deepest secrets to me, things they had never told anyone because of their fear or shame of being different, or thinking something was wrong. I had women burst into tears of relief when they learned they were normal and healthy. They just didn’t have the correct information.</p>
<p>Media has taught us in many ways that there is something wrong with our bodies. Advertisements are selling us the idea that we need products to improve ourselves.</p>
<p>Capitalizing on making women feel as though we are not enough. We are told we are too big, too hairy, too sexual, not sexual enough. When we have the opportunity to learn information about how our bodies work, it can open doors and allow opportunity for our pleasure and well-being.</p>
<p>As I continued teaching workshops about G spot stimulation, female masturbation and sex toys, I encouraged women to open up about their sexuality. Again, so much shame, pain, fear, and trauma would arise.  I spoke with women who didn’t know if they had ever had an orgasm. I taught a woman where her clitoris was located and why it is so important for female-bodied pleasure. Did you know there are 8,ooo nerve endings located in that tiny marvelous button?!  Most women can only come with clitoral stimulation. Get to know that magic spot. It can bring you a world of joy.</p>
<p>It's essential to get to know your own body so you can better understand what you do and don’t want and what feels good. This can help you better communicate to a partner or a lover. It also puts the control back in your hands, literally. (You can make yourself have an orgasm anytime, anyplace!) And when you have a better sense of your body, you can really be in tune with your health and wellbeing. You will notice if something isn’t right and will be able to address it more quickly. You will begin noticing patterns that go along with your menstrual cycle. You can start tracking your moods with your cycle and have a much better sense of your mental health throughout the month. This can prepare you for those days that might feel harder because of the hormone shifts happening.  You become the expert of your own health and wellbeing. Because YOU are the expert on your own body.  The more you know, the more empowered you are.</p>
<p>There is a plethora of women-focused, research-based information out there. With the click of your… button, you have a whole world of pleasure at your fingertips. There are amazing stores that have a wealth of knowledge that can be explored, with toys that you can touch and feel. There are incredible educational books and <a href="https://o.school/">websites</a> , <a href="https://www.dipseastories.com/">podcasts</a>,  and <a href="http://www.erikalust.com/">porn</a> made by, and for, women. There's erotica focused on female pleasure, and counselors you can talk to about anything that feels challenging. As someone who has explored the dynamic, layered world of sexual health education, I have found that focusing on pleasure and self -love is truly life changing. I urge you to explore what brings you joy and learn how to cultivate more pleasure in your life. It will help you navigate this world with more passion, presence and possibility.</p>

Lose weight. Have more sex.&quot;</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/378105/new-years-resolution/">Statista</a>, these are the three most common New Year’s resolutions people made last year. Ah, New Year’s resolutions—lofty intentions we set at the start of a year, pledging to be better and do better.</p>
<p>It’s a noble thought, at least at face value. But when you really start to think about it, could it be that New Year’s resolutions cause us to become hyper focused on what could be better and distract us from what we’re doing well? Might the “new-year-new-me” cliché pull us away from loving ourselves as we naturally are?</p>
<h2 id="historyofnewyearsresolutions">History of New Year’s Resolutions</h2>
<p>The origins of New Year’s resolutions date back 4000 years to the ancient Babylonians, though of course, they didn’t call them “New Year’s resolutions.&quot; The Babylonians celebrated their new year, which happened to be in the middle of March, with a ten-day festival called Akitu. During Akitu, the Babylonians honored their king and also made promises to the gods. The idea was that as long as they kept their word to repay debts that were owed, the gods would bless them. Let’s just say the consequences of breaking the promises were not desirable.</p>
<p>The Romans, who are responsible for our current calendar, also held New Year’s resolutions in high esteem. Janus, the god after whom January was named, was believed to have two faces. One looked forward into the new year, while one looked backwards into the previous year. As such, it was important for the Romans to proclaim good behavior in the upcoming year and leave their old bad habits behind.</p>
<h2 id="newyearsresolutionsinthepresentday">New Year’s Resolutions in the Present Day</h2>
<p>Many religious congregations still participate in some form of commitment-making for the new year. For example, some Protestant Christians in the African-American community participate in <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/rev-joan-r-harrell/watch-night-service-in-the-black-church-in-america-150-years-_b_2389965.html">Watch Night services</a> on New Year’s Eve. At “Watch Night”, as it’s commonly known, people often reflect on ways they could be better in the upcoming year and make proclamations to do so. Some Jewish communities also make resolutions on the Jewish new year, <a href="https://www.chabad.org/theJewishWoman/article_cdo/aid/1276335/jewish/New-Years-Resolutions.htm">Rosh Hashanah</a>.</p>
<p>Truth be told, New Year’s resolutions tend to be a predominantly secular activity in the present day. While resolution-making isn’t a traditional component of the Chinese New Year, which begins in late-January or early-February and lasts about 15 days, some people treat this lunar holiday as a sort of do-over if they’ve fallen behind on their New Year’s Day resolutions. As it turns out, <a href="https://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/eat-run/articles/2015-12-29/why-80-percent-of-new-years-resolutions-fail">80% of resolution-makers</a> have let go of their promises by mid-February.  Considering those terrible odds, perhaps we should examine the relationship between self-improvement and self-love.</p>
<h2 id="buildinghabitsofselfloveinthenewyear">Building Habits of Self-Love in the New Year</h2>
<p>We asked 10 women and men a series of three questions comparing self-love and self-improvement. All ten respondents expressed a belief that these two concepts are different and that self-love is more important, but responses to the final question were a little more interesting.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mf-blog-staticfiles/ghost-prod/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-02-at-8.35.02-AM.png" alt="New Year, Do You: The Hidden Power of Loving Yourself More in the New Year"></p>
<p>A majority acknowledged that self-improvement tends to be the highlight of the new year. But about half followed-up with comments expressing the belief that self-improvement can often be a manifestation of self-love if done in the right way. Here’s what some participants had to say:</p>
<ul>
<li>“I’m at the stage of self-improvement motivated by self-love. Self-love makes the improvement process more honest and less painful...It’s easy to be hard on yourself and compare yourself to others. But when you focus on knowing and loving yourself first, the improvement process flows much more easily.”</li>
<li>“I would say that the two are different. To me, improvement is based on negative traits you’re working to change, while self-love is manifested through the things that you do to maintain positive attributes. But now that I think about it more, maybe self-improvement could be based on highlighting positive traits too!”</li>
</ul>
<p>So what’s “the right way” to approach self-improvement? Well, of course, each person is different, so what works for one might not work for another. Different strokes for different folks and all. But examples of personal growth rooted in self-love could involve making small changes that help accentuate the things you love about yourself, being more patient with yourself when you slip up, and spending time reflecting on what you desire for yourself, rather than what society wants for you.</p>
<p>Taking a baby step approach to personal growth is also a way to set yourself up for success, which is an expression of self-love itself. Knowingly biting off more than you can realistically chew can actually be self-sabotaging behavior. When we aren’t able to accomplish the looming goals we set for ourselves, we tend to beat ourselves up about it. In reality, we may be more likely to accomplish those goals if we approach them in a step-by-step fashion. In doing so, we pave the way for self-improvement without neglecting our current selves in the process.</p>
<h2 id="whatanexpertneedsyoutoknowaboutselflove">What an Expert Needs You to Know about Self-Love</h2>
<p>Finally, to get a professional perspective on self-love and self-improvement, I got some insights from a counselor. Here’s an excerpt from my interview with Jenais Y. Means, MA, LPCA, the lead counselor at Collaborative Means.</p>
<p><em>When asked whether self-love or self-improvement is most important, Jenais had this to say:</em></p>
<p>What’s important is making mental, emotional, spiritual, and physical space for both self-love and self-improvement. Both concepts are fluid; they will look, feel, and sound differently from day to day (and sometimes hour to hour).  Be where you are.</p>
<p><em>How can women make sure efforts of self-improvement are rooted in self-love?</em></p>
<p>Being rooted in self-love means acknowledging our intentions for self-improvement. It’s okay to ask yourself, “Who gains or benefits the most from my self-love/self-improvement journey?” And it’s okay if that person is you!</p>
<p>Although self-improvement implies that who and where we are now is not who or where we want to be in the future, take time to acknowledge and appreciate the growth that brought you to your present. Finally, know that you are already enough!</p>
<p><em>What do you wish more people knew about self-love?</em></p>
<p>Loving yourself and taking steps to improve yourself both rely on self-awareness and vulnerability. Self-awareness requires us to pause and visualize ourselves as we are, visualize ourselves as we desire, and then it requires us to create a plan to achieve our desires. If you’re looking for a solid New Year’s resolution, consider making it a goal to acknowledge even the slightest amounts of personal growth, change, and development.</p>
